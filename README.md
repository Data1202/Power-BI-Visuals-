Finding 

Long-Term Evolution of Global Plastic Production (1950-2019): Visualizing the extended timeline offers a comprehensive understanding of the cumulative plastic production trends. Identification of periods with accelerated production growth informs strategies for curbing the historical impact.
Evolution of Global Plastic Waste Disposal method in world (2000-2019): 
•	The area chart dynamically illustrates the evolution of global plastic waste disposal from 2000 to 2019.
•	A clear increasing trend is visible, indicating a concerning rise in plastic waste generation and disposal over the years.
•	The integration of a slicer allows users to focus on specific years, providing a dynamic view of trends and variations.
•	The visualization emphasizes the urgent need for global initiatives to promote sustainable plastic waste management practices.
•	Recycling efforts are commendable but need to be further enhanced, and alternative disposal methods should be explored to reduce the environmental impact.
Geographical Variation in Per Capita Plastic Waste:
•	The map visualizes per capita plastic waste across different entities, providing a comprehensive view of global variations.
•	Regions with higher per capita plastic waste are visually distinct, indicating potential areas of concern for excessive plastic consumption.
•	Utilizing the slicer for the top 4 per kg waste allows for a focused examination of entities with the highest per capita plastic waste.
•	Data-driven insights enable targeted allocation of resources and the implementation of region-specific strategies for plastic waste reduction.
Global Trends in Industrial Sector Plastic Production and Waste (1990-2019): 
•	The area chart effectively illustrates the cumulative plastic waste generated by various industrial sectors each year from 1990 to 2019. The slicer focusing on the years 1990-2019 reveals the specific time frames during which industrial plastic waste reached its peak.
•	Continuous Growth: The world is producing more and more plastic each year, going from around 39.82 million tones in 1990 to 142.60 million tones in 2019.
•	 Packaging Rules: Most plastic is used for packaging products, like food and products for everyday use. Moreover, construction contributes to the increase of plastic waste all over the world. 
•	The visualization serves as a call to action by showcasing the escalation of industrial plastic waste over the years.
Entities Driving Plastic Pollution in Oceans and Rivers (2000-2019): 
•	The area chart shows the trend of plastic waste accumulating to the oceans over the years. 
•	The analysis shows the overall trend in plastic waste accumulation of top 5 entities being contributing to increase the plastic waste in the aquatic environment.
•	The accumulation of plastic waste has increased year by year for all the entities, moreover, United States has been accumulating up to 3,353,125 counts of plastic waste to aquatic environment in year 2019. 
Variability in Mismanaged Plastic Waste Per Capita Across Entities: Entity-level analysis reveals variations in mismanaged plastic waste per capita. Pinpointing entities with high mismanagement rates provide opportunities for focused interventions and support.
